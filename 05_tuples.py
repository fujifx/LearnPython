# In Python Tuple is a type data structure, which basically means
# it is a container where we can store different values. A Tuple is very
# similar a list. It's basically a structure where we can store multiple
# pieces of information. But a Tuple has few key differences from Lists
# A Tuple is immutable, basically it cannot be changes/ modified
# Tuples initiated using () whereas lists are initiated with []

# coordinates = (4, 5)        # 0 based index
# print(coordinates[0])

coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 35)]       # list of Tuples
print(coordinates[0])           # prints the 1st Tuple
